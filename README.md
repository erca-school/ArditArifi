# ArditArifi

# Purpose
This project aims to explore the impact of natural aerosol emissions on the polar region by comparing different models from the CMIP6 experiment. Specifically, it focuses on the effect of these emissions on the radiation budget and, ultimately, on the warming of the polar region.

# Important
rtmt.py and rtmt_seq.py are scripts that currently work as intended. To use them, simply set the following paths:

CMIP6 data is located - source_path
output should be stored - output_path

The difference between rtmt.py and rtmt_seq.py is in how the statistical values are computed.

# OUTPUT 
These scripts produce a dataframe (or a CSV file) showing the difference between the rtmt control experiment and the emission experiment.

# ToDo 
A lot of clean up and summarizing the code is still necessary. On the later stage we could adress possibly future impact of aerosol emissions on the polaric region.
