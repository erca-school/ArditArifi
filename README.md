# ArditArifi

# Purpose
This project aims to explore the impact of natural aersol emissions on the polaric region by intercomparing different models from CMIP6 experiment. Specifically the impact on radiation budget and ultimatevely on the warming of the polaric region due to aerosol emissions.

# Important
rtmt.py and rtmt_seq.py are scripts that are working properly now. Simply set the paths where:
CMIP6 data is located - source_path
output should be stored - output_path

The difference between rtmt and rtmt_seq is how the statistical values are computed. 

# ToDo 
A lot of clean up and summarizing the code is still necessary. On the later stage we could adress possibly future impact of aerosol emissions on the polaric region.
